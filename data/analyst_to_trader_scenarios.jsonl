{"analyst_input": "The US Federal Reserve has announced a surprise 0.25% interest rate hike.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This is bearish for the broader market, especially growth stocks.

{"analyst_input": "Company GAMA's new drug failed its Phase 3 clinical trials.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This is catastrophic news for GAMA. The stock is likely to gap down hard.

{"analyst_input": "The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data came in hotter than expected, showing persistent inflation.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "Higher inflation means the Fed will likely stay hawkish.

{"analyst_input": "A new trade tariff has been imposed on imported semiconductors.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This benefits domestic semiconductor manufacturers but hurts companies that rely on imported chips.

{"analyst_input": "Company EPSILON announced a massive share buyback program.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "Share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which is bullish for EPS. This shows management confidence. It's a solid reason to be long this stock."}
{"analyst_input": "The VIX (Volatility Index) has spiked above 30, indicating high market fear.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "High fear can be a contrarian buy signal, but it also means high risk.

{"analyst_input": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has disclosed a new large stake in Company KAPPA.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This is a huge vote of confidence from a legendary investor.

{"analyst_input": "Company LAMBDA is being acquired by a larger competitor at a 30% premium.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "If I own LAMBDA, I should hold to capture the premium.

{"analyst_input": "The Producer Price Index (PPI) shows that input costs for manufacturers are rising sharply.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This will squeeze profit margins for companies that can't pass on costs to consumers. I need to identify companies with strong pricing power and avoid those with weak margins."}
{"analyst_input": "A new weight-loss drug from Company MU is showing revolutionary results in trials.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This could be a multi-billion dollar blockbuster drug.

{"analyst_input": "Bitcoin has surged past $100,000, leading a broad crypto market rally.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This signals a 'risk-on' environment. I should look at crypto-related equities like COIN or MSTR, which act as high-beta plays on the crypto market."}
{"analyst_input": "The yield curve has inverted, a classic recession indicator.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This is a serious long-term warning sign.

{"analyst_input": "Company XI's latest smartphone model is receiving terrible reviews from tech critics.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "A failed product launch can severely impact a quarter's earnings.

{"analyst_input": "Company RHO's dividend yield has exceeded 7%, but its payout ratio is over 100%.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This high yield looks like a 'yield trap'. A dividend cut is highly likely. This is a bearish signal, not a buying opportunity. I should consider shorting it."}
{"analyst_input": "The latest jobs report was much weaker than expected across the board.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "A weak labor market signals a slowing economy.

{"analyst_input": "Company OMEGA is facing a class-action lawsuit regarding its labor practices.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "Lawsuits create a long-term negative overhang and potential for large fines. The headline risk alone is enough to make me avoid the stock. Clear 'avoid' signal."}
{"analyst_input": "Stock has been trading in a tight range for months and volume is drying up.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This consolidation is a sign of a big move coming. I should set alerts for a breakout above the range resistance or a breakdown below the range support to catch the next trend."}
{"analyst_input": "The government has announced new subsidies for electric vehicle purchases.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This is a direct tailwind for EV manufacturers like TSLA, RIVN, and also for lithium and battery suppliers.

It suggests those with the most information are not optimistic. I should be cautious here."}
{"analyst_input": "A new viral video trend is causing a surge in demand for a product made by Company GAMMA.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This is a powerful, albeit potentially short-lived, catalyst.

It's a broad-based bearish signal for the global economy. Time to increase defensiveness."}
{"analyst_input": "Company DELTA has announced a 2-for-1 stock split.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "A stock split has zero impact on the company's fundamental value.

{"analyst_input": "A famous short-seller has just published a negative report on Company OMEGA.", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This will put immediate and intense downward pressure on the stock.

{"analyst_input": "The latest inflation report shows prices falling faster than expected (disinflation).", "ideal_trader_starting_thought": "This is the 'goldilocks' scenario the market loves.
